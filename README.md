The lane detection system assists in accurately identifying and tracking lanes. This information helps the vehicle navigate safely into the parking spot.
This project focuses on implementing a lane detection system using python opencv. The goal is to detect and highlight lanes on images or video streams, primarily in the context of autonomous vehicles or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
